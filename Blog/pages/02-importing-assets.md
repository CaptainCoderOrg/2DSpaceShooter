## What is an Asset?

In Unity, an asset is any file or resource used to create and enhance your game
or interactive application. Assets can include 3D models, images, audio clips,
scripts, animations, and more. They are fundamental building blocks in Unity's
development process, and you can organize and manipulate them within the Unity
Editor to bring your game to life.

## Download the Assets

1. Download the project assets: [LINK](../files/Space-Shooter-Kenny-Assets-v0.zip)

3. Right click in the `Assets`` Folder
4. Select `Create > Folder`
5. Name your folder `Sprites`

**Note:** You can rename a folder by right clicking and selecting `Rename`

### Importing Sprites

You can import files into a Unity project by dragging them into the project window. The file will be added to the location that is currently selected.

1. Open the `Sprites` folder
2. Drag the `enemyShip.png` asset into the project
